Adding an image carousel would allow me to quickly showcase my work in the ↯ Artwork tab. It would also give me the know-how to add additional features as mentioned in the conclusion.

# Conclusion
We now have image carousels for the quick viewing of artwork in the ↯ Artwork tab!

Some additional features I could work on with this new knowledge would be latest post section to the homepage, or add a windows file-explorer type menu for large amounts of files to be shared on the website, or even a scrolling announcement-type billboard for showing any changes/updates on the homepage directly.
