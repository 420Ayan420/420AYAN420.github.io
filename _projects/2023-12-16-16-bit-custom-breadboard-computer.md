Let's use the digital logic simulator to build a 16-bit custom computer with a 32-bit address bus using 7000 series of ICs on a breadboard, let's also first run the design in the my digital logic simulator to ensure that it works correctly before building it. Let's also try to keep complexity low by cheating and using dedicated memory ICs rather than building our own memory from scratch.
