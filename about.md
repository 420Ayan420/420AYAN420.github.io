# Whoms't
Greetings! I am Ayan Ali; a Year 12 student studying A-levels. I really enjoy making things, creating 3D art, and working on complex problems in an engineering context. This website acts as a place for me to share my passions in such subjects (and mayhaps some ramblings on niche topics).

# Notable Achievements
- Completed IGCSEs in Summer 2022.
- Awarded OPLA Award for Highest Mark in GCSE Design and Technology in the Middle East.
- Awarded Pearson Edexcel Excellence Award for outstanding results at IGCSE.
- Took part in an "Academy of Excellence" enrichment program for 5+ years.

- Published a 3D-modelling curriculum with the aim of getting students from grades 9-11 more involved with CAD/CAM and STEM in general, in essence it teaches how to design systems from 0 to an intermediate level in an engineering based context. Deployed to 11 schools currently or around ~3100 eligible students. Plans to deploy internationally to ~53 schools or ~15000 eligible students.
- Designed, manufactured, and tested my own Cantilever 3D-printer.
- Designed, manufactured, and tested my own solar-powered water desalination device for regions with polluted water. (Produced a complementary paper of ~7500 words outlining the process of research, construction, usage, etc.)
- Designed, manufactured, and tested my own deployable water catcher device for arid regions. (Produced a complementary paper of ~35000 words outlining the process of research, construction, usage, etc.)
- Designed, programmed, and tested my own digital logic circuit simulator.
- my own CSS+HTML+JS based website. With in-progress ray-traced graphics for coolness factor on website.
- Produced a 20000 word research paper on perpetual solar flight as part of my EPQ. (with perhaps publishing an extended 25000-35000 word paper).
- Completed AS-levels in Summer 2023.
