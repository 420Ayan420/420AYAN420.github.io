Airships, the word air and ship are combined to create airship. What if I took the meaning literally and created a ship-that-is-in-the-air while still basing the artistic design in reality and still having some semblance of plausibility?

        Let's first start with a smaller general purpose onto engineer ships, barges, aircraft carriers, etc. First page is a 4K rendering of the model, it is not complete yet but I thought I'd make this render just to showcase some of the details. The second page is very small as it is just 1080p to keep render times down.

        Let's integrate the airship into the landscape, getting the lighting right is bit hard but I think I got there in the end.

        I tried to do a sandstorm type scene, it looks very dead (as no crew or lights), and looks more like mars than Earth. Tried to put in some VHS recording type graphics, not too fond of them.

Some further ideas could include:
  1. Engineer Barges and Tow-boats
  2. Battleships and Destroyers
  3. Aircraft Carriers
  4. Perhaps have a trading outpost with ships docked very high-up in the mountains like in the following image.
