Bladerunner was such an awesome series, lets make a scene paying homage to that. In the process additional techniques are learned to aid faster scene creation in the future.

          Decided to expand and build out the scene, I first modelled a building from an image (see bottom of this post).

          Experimenting with rain, trying not to spend too much time as I might not like it. The button on the right in the last render are comically large.

There is a lot more I'd like to do:
1.  Create large expansive city scene, already have created the assets. Perhaps make it a rain scene?
2.  Add a spaceship docking bay like those ones in Star Wars, they look really cool.
3.  Fix the window lighting - something to do with the refraction of the glass material or something.

All these renders have come from one image to texture the model:
