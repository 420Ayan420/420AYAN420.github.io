A brief history of solar flight with analysis of existing data; an explanation on the concepts leading to solar flight; narrowing existing technology to a feasible flight model; modeling through fluid simulation and power-metrics; and producing a possible prototype. Plans to extend paper and publish instead of just submitting as an EPQ.
