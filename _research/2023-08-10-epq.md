title: "The feasibility solar-powered, sustained, and autonomous flight"
layout: page
---
A brief history of solar flight with analysis of existing data; an explanation on the concepts leading to solar flight; narrowing existing technology to a feasible flight model; modeling through fluid simulation and power-metrics; and producing a possible prototype. Plans to extend paper and publish instead of just submitting as an EPQ.

### The EPQ is currently in the marking stage and thus cannot be posted here until marking is complete. Paper due to be posted in the month of september.
