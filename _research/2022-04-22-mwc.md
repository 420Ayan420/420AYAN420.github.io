Mountain regions placed a certain altitudes can become arid due to the scarcity of water. This is due to the mountains being too high for a viable well to be dug to tap into the ground water table; the mountains having certain meterological conditions that prevent precipitation; and are mild in temperature and thus there is no rainwater and or snow. Through biomimicry of "cloud forests" we are able to provide water for such regions and support communities who would have to otherwise traverse 5-6 hours for water.
